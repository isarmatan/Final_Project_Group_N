Parking Simulation Scalability Test Documentation
=================================================

This document describes the scalability and stress tests designed to verify the simulation's performance and stability under varied grid sizes and high vehicle counts (over 100 cars).

Scalability Scenarios
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scenario: large_grid_sparse
---------------------------
Description: Tests pathfinding capabilities over a large area with relatively sparse traffic. This verifies that the A* algorithm scales well spatially.
Grid Size: 50x30 (1500 cells)
Configuration:
  - Rules: 4 Entries, 4 Exits, 200 Parking Spots
  - Simulation:
    - Initial Active Cars: 20 (Intent: EXIT)
    - Initial Parked Cars: 50
    - New Arrivals: 50 (Lambda: 0.5)
    - Total Cars Involved: 120
Expected Output:
  - Cars successfully navigate long distances across the large map.
  - No timeouts or excessive planning delays.
  - SUCCESS: All cars exit or park successfully.

Scenario: medium_grid_heavy_load
--------------------------------
Description: A medium-sized grid subjected to a heavy load of 120 cars. This tests collision resolution and reservation table performance when space is moderately constrained.
Grid Size: 30x20 (600 cells)
Configuration:
  - Rules: 3 Entries, 3 Exits, 150 Parking Spots
  - Simulation:
    - Initial Active Cars: 10 (Intent: EXIT)
    - Initial Parked Cars: 40
    - New Arrivals: 70 (Lambda: 0.6)
    - Total Cars Involved: 120
Expected Output:
  - Robust handling of 100+ agents interacting.
  - Efficient resolution of traffic jams near entries/exits.
  - SUCCESS: All 10 initial active cars exit, and all 70 arriving cars find parking spots.

Scenario: massive_congestion
----------------------------
Description: A stress test with 200 cars on a large 40x40 grid. This is the ultimate test for the system's throughput and stability limits.
Grid Size: 40x40 (1600 cells)
Configuration:
  - Rules: 5 Entries, 5 Exits, 300 Parking Spots
  - Simulation:
    - Initial Active Cars: 20 (Intent: EXIT)
    - Initial Parked Cars: 80
    - New Arrivals: 100 (Lambda: 0.8 - Very fast arrivals)
    - Total Cars Involved: 200
Expected Output:
  - The simulation completes without crashing or deadlocking.
  - It manages to process 200 unique car agents.
  - SUCCESS: All 20 initial active cars exit, and all 100 arriving cars find parking spots.
