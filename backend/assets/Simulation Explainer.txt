Simulation Explainer:

Main -> soon to be replaced with a controller for future connectivity with frontend.

To generate a simulation we need:

A. Grid generation:

    via auto generator:
    1) Generating parking lot rules: (number of entrances, number of exits, number of parking spots)
    2) Grid generation using parking_lot.generator.generate()

    via (future) database that stores user input from Parking Lot Editor component:
    /--- to be edited----/

B. Cells extraction:
    purpose: to determine which cells are parking spots, exits or entrances.

    done by using function extract_cells(grid) that's currently defined in Main.

C. ParkingManager (domain logic) initiation requires providing the grid and the extracted cells from the previous step.

D. ReservationTable:
    purpose: 
        The ReservationTable is a space-time occupancy index.
        It answers four questions:

        Is cell (x, y) free at time t?

        Is edge (x1, y1) -> (x2, y2) free at time t?

        Can I reserve a whole path?

        Can I reserve a goal forever?
    
E. PriorityPlanner:
    purpose: A policy layer.
        
        Its responsibilities are:

        1) Decide priority order

        2) Call the single-agent planner

        3) Reserve the resulting path

        4) Attach the path to the car

F. Config -> to be replaced with inputs from user when configuring the simulation.
    will contain: 
    1) numbers of inactive cars that are occupying parking spots
    2) number of cars that initially exist in the parking lot at random spots that plan to EXIT.
    3) number of TOTAL cars that will be entering the parking lot during the simulation in poisson distribution times.
    4) lambda (for poisson)
    5) timeout parameter (no solution -> error)
    6) grid selection (generate/load from DB)


The result:
SimulationCore (this is our simulation) -> it needs all of the above.
